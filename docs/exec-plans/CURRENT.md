# Current execution plan: autonomous workflow migration recovery

## Baseline

- Repository: `D:\openkill`
- Branch: `master`
- HEAD: `1a9678bc99745fe6183fac92e0ad4995e36c384e`
- Working tree: clean at migration start
- Remote: `origin` → `https://github.com/dinggood615/openkill.git`
- Source version: `2026-1127`
- Historical release: `v2026-1127-ipk` (published by the former push-triggered
  workflow; retained as incident evidence)

The repository did not previously contain a project `AGENTS.md` or a
`docs/exec-plans/CURRENT.md`; this file establishes the missing source of
truth for autonomous work.

## Frozen product evidence

The local 3E.2D chain is complete through D2C: continuity and coherent
snapshot, BusyBox normalization and byte preflight, Mark ABI mapping, CURRENT
renderer, bounded parser, conditional inventory classification, ownership
projection, and DNS field reconciliation. The historical device target was
`.102`; this recovery performs no device access.

- D2A: required absence fails closed; conditional/inactive absence reaches the
  comparator.
- D2B: legacy-only WAN safety remains observed but out of CURRENT-owned parity;
  DNS fields are typed and 53 is never equated to 7874.
- D2C: the checked-in mode-1 contract is firewall/dnsmasq `:53` forwarding to
  Mihomo `127.0.0.1:7874`; direct mode-2 remains separate.
- Known gaps: device revalidation after D2C, documented TUN BC-04 behavior,
  access overlap not observed, TPROXY not observed, and no central apply or
  packet-path approval.

## CI recovery

The old compile workflow ran on every `master` push. Its first run after the
D2C commit failed because source `2026-1126` equaled the already published
channel version. The source was advanced to `2026-1127`, the package rebuilt,
and the release succeeded. This exposed the process defect: development pushes
could publish. The migration changes make development CI, manual RC build,
and manual formal release independent.

Latest known CI before this recovery: development validation, runtime matrix,
package compilation, publication, and cache cleanup all passed for
`1a9678b`; the published IPK digest was
`07723684b420b0f5c949f519cca06f91f115184d21ee6ae0354bf41494905b15`.

## Work items

1. Add the repository agent guide and execution-plan source of truth.
2. Separate development CI, artifact-only RC builds, and formal releases.
3. Add dependency-light preflight, local-gate, and CI-separation helpers.
4. Run the full local matrix and inspect the final diff.
5. Commit only these migration changes, push them, and verify development CI.

Do not bump the version, publish a release, access a device, continue Phase 4,
or change product semantics as part of this plan.

## Recovery result

The migration work is limited to workflow, documentation, and dependency-light
local gates. `OpenKill Development CI` is the only push/PR path; the RC build
is manual and artifact-only; the formal release is manual and requires both
release inputs. The source version remains `2026-1127` and no release was
published by this recovery.

The local gate, workflow contract tests, shell/YAML/version validation, core
compatibility matrix, installer, runtime, renderer, parser, shadow,
continuity, network, snapshot/FW4, Stage D, classifier, semantic, NFT IR, and
central-wiring suites pass under their supported Windows/WSL entry points.
The nft syntax suite also passes its explicit unavailable-tool contract when
the host cannot execute `nft`; no package was installed to change that result.
The only expected local skips are the existing Ruby-dependent tests.

No device or router was accessed. The historical `v2026-1127-ipk` publication
remains retained as incident evidence; this recovery does not delete, alter,
or republish it.
